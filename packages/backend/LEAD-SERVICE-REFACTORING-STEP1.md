# Lead Service Refactoring - Step 1 Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the backend refactoring completed as Step 1 of the lead data source realignment from D365 `Contact` entity to `tc_everychildlead` entity.

## Changes Made

### 1. D365 Mappings Constants (`src/constants/d365-mappings.ts`)
- Created centralized mapping file for D365 option sets
- Added lead status mappings (integers to strings)
- Added lead type mappings based on engagement interest
- Added organization lead type constants (Foster: 948010000, Volunteer: 948010001)
- Implemented helper functions: `mapLeadStatus()`, `mapLeadType()`, `hasOrganizationType()`
- Documented the complex volunteer organization filter syntax

### 2. Lead Service Updates (`src/services/lead.service.ts`)
- **Entity Change**: Now queries `/tc_everychildleads` instead of `/contacts`
- **Security Enhancement**: Added fail-secure check - returns empty results if organizationId missing
- **Organization Filtering**: 
  - Foster: Direct filter on `_tc_fosterorganization_value`
  - Volunteer: Many-to-many relationship using `tc_eclead_tc_ecleadsvolunteerorg_eclead/any()`
  - Supports organizations with both types
- **Data Expansion**: Added `$expand` for `tc_contact` and `tc_leadowner` lookups
- **Validation**: Added organizationLeadType format validation
- **Mapping**: Updated `mapD365ToLead()` to transform tc_everychildlead to existing Lead interface
- **Removed**: Temporarily removed `updateLead()` method (read-only for Step 1)

### 3. Type Definitions
- Updated `D365Filter` interface to include `organizationLeadType` and `organizationName`
- Updated `OrganizationData` in shared types to include `organizationLeadType`
- Enhanced middleware to populate these fields from JWT

### 4. D365 Service Enhancement (`src/services/d365.service.ts`)
- Fixed organization data mapping to include `organizationLeadType` field
- Ensures JWT contains necessary data for organization-based filtering

### 5. Controller Updates (`src/controllers/lead.controller.ts`)
- Disabled `updateLead` endpoint with 501 status (Not Implemented)
- Added message explaining updates will be re-enabled after migration

### 6. Test Coverage (`src/services/__tests__/lead.service.test.ts`)
- Added comprehensive unit tests for lead service
- Tests organization type filtering scenarios
- Tests null safety for expanded entities
- Tests security boundaries (initiative verification)

## Security Considerations

1. **Initiative Filtering**: Maintained as primary security boundary
2. **Organization Filtering**: Added as secondary filter based on JWT claims
3. **Fail-Secure**: Service returns empty results if organization context missing
4. **Audit Logging**: All queries logged with security context
5. **Cross-Initiative Protection**: Leads outside user's initiative return null

## Backward Compatibility

1. **Lead Interface**: Maintained existing structure (temporary mapping)
2. **API Endpoints**: Same URLs and response format
3. **Error Handling**: Consistent error codes and messages
4. **Default Behavior**: Falls back to foster filter if organizationLeadType missing

## Known Limitations (To Address in Future Steps)

1. **Lead Types**: Current mapping is simplified (foster/volunteer/other)
2. **Status Values**: Limited set mapped, others default to 'other'
3. **Update Operations**: Disabled until data model migration complete
4. **Field Mapping**: Some tc_everychildlead fields not yet exposed

## Performance Considerations

1. **Expanded Queries**: May impact response time with large datasets
2. **Pagination**: Limited to 100 records max per request
3. **Complex Filters**: Volunteer organization filter uses subquery

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with users having Foster-only access
2. Test with users having Volunteer-only access
3. Test with users having both Foster and Volunteer access
4. Test with missing organizationLeadType (backward compatibility)
5. Verify no cross-initiative data leakage

## Next Steps

### Step 2: Shared Package Updates
- Update Lead interface to match tc_everychildlead structure
- Add new status and type enums
- Update LeadFilters interface

### Step 3: Frontend Updates
- Update components to use new Lead fields
- Remove obsolete filter controls
- Update table columns and card displays
