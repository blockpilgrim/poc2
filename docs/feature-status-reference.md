A: No, backend doesn't support it yet. UI is ready.

**Q: Can I create new leads?**  
A: No, POST endpoint not implemented.

**Q: Can I update lead information?**  
A: No, PATCH endpoint returns 501.

**Q: Can I search for leads?**  
A: Yes, text search is fully functional.

**Q: Why are some dropdowns disabled?**  
A: UI is built for future features, disabled until backend support.

**Q: What data is automatically filtered?**  
A: Initiative (state) and organization based on JWT claims.

## Development Tips

1. **Check this guide first** before implementing features
2. **Test with search** - it's the only working filter
3. **Don't remove disabled UI** - backend support coming
4. **Use title attributes** for disabled elements
5. **Check Backend API Reference** for endpoint details
