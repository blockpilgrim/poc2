# Partner Portal v2.0 (Vite + React + Express) - Project Charter

## Project Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developing the Partner Portal v2.0. The project transitions from our current model of disparate, cloned Power Pages instances to a **single, centralized platform** built using a decoupled architecture with Vite + React (frontend) and Express.js (backend).

This strategic shift is driven by the critical need to overcome the scalability limitations, maintenance overhead, and branding inflexibility inherent in the previous multi-instance approach. Partner Portal v2.0 aims to deliver a unified, scalable, and maintainable solution that efficiently supports our expanding operations across multiple U.S. states, each represented as an "Initiative."

A core tenet of this project is to **preserve and potentially enhance the existing lead management capabilities** currently valued by our external partner organizations. This includes secure access to assigned leads, comprehensive dashboard views with filtering and search, detailed lead information management, and role-based access control tailored to their organizational context (e.g., differentiating access for Foster and Volunteer journeys, and scoping visibility to specific organizations or network-wide).

The new architecture, detailed herein, emphasizes clear separation of concerns, API-first design, robust security through initiative-based data segregation, and dynamic theming. This will provide a modern, reliable, and intuitive interface for our partners, significantly reducing operational burdens and accelerating the delivery of future improvements.

### Purpose

The Partner Portal v2.0 project implements a decoupled Single Page Application (SPA) + API architecture to serve as a Proof of Concept (POC) and foundational platform. This POC aims to:

* **Validate Architecture:** Demonstrate that a Vite + React frontend and an Express.js backend can effectively meet our organization's requirements for a centralized, scalable, and maintainable multi-state partner portal.
* **Deliver Core Functionality:** Build essential features focused on secure authentication, initiative-based data segregation, dynamic theming, and core lead management capabilities.
* **Establish Best Practices:** Implement and refine development patterns, security measures, and deployment strategies for this new architecture.
* **Mitigate Scalability Risks:** Directly address the limitations of the current "cloned instance" model by proving a single platform's ability to support multiple U.S. state "initiatives" with distinct branding and data boundaries.
* **Enhance Developer Experience:** Leverage modern tooling and a clear separation of concerns to improve development velocity and knowledge sharing.

This initiative will confirm the chosen technology stack's suitability to replace the existing Power Pages solution, providing a robust foundation for future enhancements and national rollout.

### Guiding Principles

- **Security**: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Stability**: Build reliable, predictable, and fault-tolerant systems
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and multi-state expansion
- **Maintainability**: Create clean, documented, and modular code
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Build code that's accessible across all experience levels
- **Clarity**: Develop intuitive interfaces and clear code patterns
- **Simplicity**: Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Modern Best Practices**: Utilize current industry standards and patterns
- **Efficiency**: Eliminate redundant processes and optimize for both development velocity and system performance

## Architecture Overview

**Important Note for AI Agents:** This document contains references such as "(portable from Next.js)" or "(adapted from Next.js)". These allude to components and logic from a previous, internal Next.js prototype. You do not require any further context or code from this Next.js prototype to understand and assist with the goals of this current Vite + React + Express project. These notes primarily serve as reminders for the human developer leading this project.

### Frontend (Vite + React SPA)

- **State Management**:
  - Zustand for UI state with structured store architecture (portable from Next.js)
  - TanStack Query (latest stable version) for server state (portable from Next.js)
  - State persistence layer for user preferences and filters
  - Multi-tab synchronization for consistency
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod (portable from Next.js)
- **Tables**: TanStack Table (latest stable version) (portable from Next.js)
- **Development**: Vite dev server with proxy to Express API
- **Deployment**: Azure Static Web Apps

### Backend (Express API)
- **Runtime**: Node.js (latest LTS version - currently 22.x) with Express (latest stable version - currently 5.x) and TypeScript
- **Authentication**: MSAL Node (official Microsoft library)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI documentation
- **Validation**: Zod for request/response validation
- **D365 Integration**: Existing D365 service code (adapted from Next.js)
- **Initiative Security**: Mandatory initiative-based filtering on all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware
- **Security**: Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting, initiative boundary enforcement
- **Deployment**: Azure App Service or Azure Functions

### Shared Infrastructure
- **TypeScript Types**: Shared types package for frontend/backend contracts
- **Initiative Configuration**: Centralized theme and branding definitions
- **State Patterns**: Documented state management conventions
- **Environment Config**: Separate .env files for frontend/backend
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps with parallel frontend/backend pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights for both layers with initiative tracking

## Multi-State Initiative Architecture

### Initiative Context
Each U.S. state expansion is managed through security groups in Microsoft Entra ID:
- Users are assigned to Entra ID security groups (e.g., "Partner Portal - EC Oregon - All Users", "Partner Portal - EC Oregon - Foster Only")
- Portal users see initiative-specific theming based on their Entra ID group membership
- **Critical**: Users can ONLY access data tagged with their initiative
- **Group Structure**: Two-tier system with "All Users" groups for base access and role-specific groups (Foster Only, Volunteer Only, etc.)
- **Implementation**: System uses immutable GUIDs for group identification, not names, ensuring reliability

### Security Model
Microsoft Entra ID groups serve as the **hard security boundary**:
1. JWT tokens include group GUIDs which are mapped to initiatives
2. All API endpoints enforce initiative-based filtering using GUID-based claims
3. Frontend queries include initiative in all data requests
4. Cross-initiative access attempts trigger security alerts
5. No dependency on Microsoft Graph API during authentication for better performance and reliability

### Role-Based Access Control
Microsoft Entra ID App Roles will define user permissions. The roles are designed to provide granular access based on user responsibilities and organizational structure:

-   **Admin**: Retains full access to all features and administrative functions within their assigned initiative.
-   **Foster Partner**: Granted access to all portal features specifically related to foster journeys, but this access is restricted to foster journeys associated with the user's own organization.
-   **Volunteer Partner**: Granted access to all portal features specifically related to volunteer journeys, with access limited to volunteer journeys associated with the user's own organization.
-   **Volunteer Network-Wide Partner**: Possesses comprehensive access to all portal features concerning volunteer journeys, with the ability to view and manage volunteer journeys across all participating organizations within the network.
-   **Foster Network-Wide Partner**: Possesses comprehensive access to all portal features concerning foster journeys, with the ability to view and manage foster journeys across all participating organizations within the network.

Roles will be assigned in Microsoft Entra ID and will be included as claims in the JWT, enabling the application to enforce permissions accordingly.

## Development Approach

### Version Management Strategy

**Core Dependency Versions**: The major dependency versions specified in this charter have been verified as of the last charter update and are suitable for project initialization.

**Feature-Specific Dependencies**: When implementing features that require new dependencies, verify latest stable versions before installation:

1. **Web Search First**: Perform a web search to confirm the latest stable versions of new dependencies
2. **Official Sources**: Check npm registry, official GitHub releases, and documentation
3. **Avoid Assumptions**: Don't assume training data contains the latest versions
4. **Document Versions**: Record specific versions in `VERSIONS.md` when installed

Example verification process for new dependencies:
```bash
# Before adding new feature dependencies
npm view [new-package]@latest version
npm view [another-package]@latest version
```

### Parallel Development Strategy

Unlike the Next.js POC approach, the decoupled architecture allows for parallel frontend/backend development:

1. **API-First Design**: Define OpenAPI contracts with initiative requirements
2. **Mock Development**: Frontend can use mock APIs with test initiatives
3. **Independent Testing**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
4. **Progressive Integration**: Connect real APIs as they're ready

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Why MSAL Node over Auth.js?
- Official Microsoft library with guaranteed Azure AD compatibility
- Better suited for API-based authentication flows
- More control over token handling and validation
- Direct support for advanced Azure AD features including groups and app roles
- Native support for extracting Entra ID claims from tokens

#### GUID-Based Initiative Mapping
- **Immutability**: GUIDs never change, unlike group names
- **Performance**: No Microsoft Graph API calls during token validation
- **Reliability**: Works even when Graph API is unavailable
- **Security**: Smaller attack surface with no external dependencies
- **Standards Compliance**: Aligns with Microsoft's intended design for group claims

#### API Design Principles
- RESTful design with consistent naming
- Versioned endpoints (/api/v1/...)
- Mandatory initiative filtering on all data endpoints
- Standardized error responses
- Comprehensive request/response validation
- HATEOAS where beneficial

#### Frontend State Strategy
- **Server State**: TanStack Query exclusively for API data
  - Query keys always include initiative
  - Automatic cache invalidation on initiative change
- **UI State**: Structured Zustand stores with clear separation:
  - `useAuthStore`: Authentication, user profile, initiative, theme
  - `useUIStore`: Loading states, modals, notifications
  - `useFilterStore`: Global filters, search parameters, table states
- **Form State**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **URL State**: React Router for navigation and deep linking
- **Persistence**: Selective state persistence with fallback strategies
- **Synchronization**: Multi-tab consistency via BroadcastChannel API

#### Initiative-Based Architecture
```typescript
// JWT Token Structure
interface JWTPayload {
  sub: string;
  email: string;
  groups: string[]; // Entra ID security groups (e.g., ["Partner Portal - EC Arkansas", "Partner Portal - EC Oregon - Testing"])
  roles: string[]; // Entra ID app roles (e.g., ["Admin", "Foster Partner", "Volunteer Network-Wide Partner"])
  initiative: string; // Primary initiative derived from groups
  exp: number;
}

// Query Key Factory with Initiative
const queryKeys = {
  leads: (initiative: string, filters?: LeadFilters) =>
    ['leads', initiative, filters] as const,

  lead: (initiative: string, id: string) =>
    ['leads', initiative, id] as const,
};

// Backend Middleware
const enforceInitiative = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract initiative from JWT (already processed during auth)
  const userInitiative = req.user.initiative;

  if (!userInitiative) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'No initiative access' });
  }

  // Inject D365 filter with initiative constraint
  const d365Filter = {
    initiative: userInitiative,
    userId: req.user.sub
  };

  req.d365Filter = d365Filter;

  // Log access for security audit
  logSecurityEvent('D365_FILTER_APPLIED', {
    userId: req.user.sub,
    email: req.user.email,
    initiative: userInitiative,
    filter: d365Filter,
    endpoint: `${req.method} ${req.path}`
  });

  next();
};

// Theme Configuration
// Themes are mapped by initiative ID (not group name) for consistency
const initiativeThemes: Record<string, ThemeConfig> = {
  'ec-arkansas': {
    primaryColor: '#00B274',
    secondaryColor: '#313E48',
    logo: '/logos/arkansas.svg',
    favicon: '/favicons/arkansas.ico',
    name: 'Arkansas Partner Portal',
  },
  'ec-tennessee': {
    primaryColor: '#F38359',
    secondaryColor: '#313E48',
    logo: '/logos/tennessee.svg',
    favicon: '/favicons/tennessee.ico',
    name: 'Tennessee Partner Portal',
  },
};
```

#### Security Considerations
- **Frontend**: CSP, secure token storage, input sanitization
- **Backend**: Rate limiting, CORS, helmet.js, input validation
- **Communication**: HTTPS only, JWT with short expiry
- **Data**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **State**: No sensitive data in persisted state
- **Initiative Boundary**: Enforced at API level, monitored continuously

### Migration Path from Next.js

1. **Phase 1**: Port UI components and establish design system
2. **Phase 2**: Implement authentication with MSAL and initiative support
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate business logic to Express API with initiative filtering
4. **Phase 4**: Connect frontend to real API with initiative-aware queries
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and security hardening

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Frontend development
cd packages/frontend
npm run dev              # Starts Vite dev server on port 5173

# Backend development
cd packages/backend
npm run dev              # Starts Express with nodemon on port 3000

# Full stack development
docker-compose up        # Runs both with proper networking

# Testing with different initiatives
npm run dev:arkansas     # Test with Arkansas theme/data
npm run dev:kentucky     # Test with Kentucky theme/data
```

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) Summary

Beyond specific features, Partner Portal v2.0 must adhere to the following key non-functional requirements to ensure its success and long-term viability:

* **Scalability:**
    * Support a growing number of "Initiatives" (target: 50+ U.S. states) without degradation in performance or requiring separate deployments.
    * Handle a significant number of concurrent users (target: 1000+) efficiently.
    * Allow independent scaling of frontend and backend services.
* **Performance:**
    * Initial application load time: < 2 seconds.
    * Route transitions and data interactions: < 500 milliseconds.
    * Efficient data handling for large datasets on dashboards (e.g., tables with 1000+ records).
* **Maintainability:**
    * Single codebase for core platform logic, minimizing redundancy (target: <15% code duplication across initiative-specific configurations).
    * Modular design with clear separation of concerns (frontend, backend, shared types).
    * Comprehensive documentation for code, APIs, and operational procedures.
    * High test coverage (unit, integration, E2E) to facilitate safe and rapid changes.
* **Security:**
    * Strict enforcement of "Initiative" as a hard security boundary, preventing any cross-initiative data access.
    * Secure authentication via Azure AD (MSAL Node).
    * Protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
    * Role-based access control (RBAC) ensuring users only access features and data relevant to their roles and initiative.
    * Data encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest where applicable.
* **Availability & Reliability:**

## Current Focus Area

**Phase:** MVP Stage Core Features - Phase 1 COMPLETE ✅ → Phase 2: Data Fetching Layer

**Status:** Phase 1 State Management Foundation is COMPLETE!

**✅ Phase 1 Completed (State Management):**
- ✅ **uiStore** implemented with:
  - Loading states with stack-based management for concurrent operations
  - Modal system supporting confirm/alert/custom types with callbacks
  - Toast notifications with auto-dismiss and action support
  - Navigation state (sidebar/mobile menu)
  - Full TypeScript types and JSDoc documentation
- ✅ **filterStore** implemented with:
  - Comprehensive lead filtering (status, type, assignee, organization, priority, tags, date range)
  - Search with automatic pagination reset
  - Sorting with smart toggle behavior
  - Pagination state management
  - Persistence for selected filters (using Zustand persist middleware)
  - URL sync helper for deep linking
  - Generic table filter support for future entities
- ✅ **Store utilities** created:
  - Type-safe utility functions in `stores/utils.ts`
  - Shared types in `stores/types.ts`
  - Robust ID generation and error handling
- ✅ All stores follow existing patterns from `authStore`
- ✅ Central exports updated in `stores/index.ts`

**🏗️ Infrastructure Ready for Phase 2:**
- Backend Lead API: Fully operational at `/api/v1/leads` with initiative filtering
- TanStack Query: QueryClient configured with auth interceptors
- API Client: Axios instance ready at `/packages/frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts`
- TypeScript Types: Lead types available in `@partner-portal/shared`
- Authentication: JWT tokens automatically included in requests

**🔧 Key Technical Context for Phase 2:**

**Store Integration Points:**
```typescript
// uiStore can manage loading states for queries
const { startLoading, stopLoading, showToast } = useUIStore();

// filterStore provides filter state for queries
const { leadFilters } = useFilterStore();
const queryKey = ['leads', leadFilters];

// authStore provides initiative context
const { initiative } = useAuthStore();
```

**API Endpoints Available:**
- `GET /api/v1/leads` - List with pagination/filtering (returns `PaginatedResponse<Lead>`)
- `GET /api/v1/leads/:id` - Single lead details (returns `Lead`)
- `PATCH /api/v1/leads/:id` - Update lead (partial `Lead` updates)
- `GET /api/v1/leads/stats` - Lead statistics

**Backend Security:**
- Initiative filtering is automatic (enforced by middleware)
- Cross-initiative access returns 404
- All queries logged with `D365_FILTER_APPLIED` events

**🎯 Phase 2: Data Fetching Layer (Ready to Start):**

### Phase 2: Implement Data Fetching Layer (Next Session)

**Directory Structure:**
```
/packages/frontend/src/
├── hooks/
│   ├── queries/
│   │   ├── leads/
│   │   │   ├── useLeads.ts         # List query with filters
│   │   │   ├── useLead.ts          # Single lead query
│   │   │   ├── useUpdateLead.ts    # Update mutation
│   │   │   ├── useCreateLead.ts    # Create mutation (if needed)
│   │   │   └── index.ts            # Barrel export
│   │   └── index.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── services/
    ├── apiClient.ts                 # ✅ Already exists
    └── queryClient.ts               # ✅ Already configured
```

**Key Implementation Requirements:**
1. **Query Keys Factory Pattern:**
   ```typescript
   const leadKeys = {
     all: ['leads'] as const,
     lists: () => [...leadKeys.all, 'list'] as const,
     list: (filters: LeadFilters) => [...leadKeys.lists(), filters] as const,
     details: () => [...leadKeys.all, 'detail'] as const,
     detail: (id: string) => [...leadKeys.details(), id] as const,
   };
   ```

2. **Store Integration:**
   - Use `filterStore` for query parameters
   - Update `filterStore` pagination after successful queries
   - Use `uiStore` for error toasts and modals
   - Avoid duplicating loading states (use TanStack Query's isLoading)

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Transform API errors to user-friendly messages
   - Show toasts for errors using `uiStore.showToast()`
   - Handle 404s gracefully (could mean no access)

4. **Type Safety:**
   - Use types from `@partner-portal/shared`
   - Ensure proper typing for query functions
   - Type-safe error handling

### Phase 3: Build Lead Management UI (After Phase 2)

**Component Architecture:**
```
/packages/frontend/src/
├── components/
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── DataTable/
│   │   │   ├── DataTable.tsx           # Generic table component
│   │   │   ├── DataTablePagination.tsx # Pagination controls
│   │   │   ├── DataTableToolbar.tsx    # Filters and search
│   │   │   └── index.ts
│   │   ├── LeadTable/
│   │   │   ├── LeadTable.tsx           # Lead-specific table
│   │   │   ├── columns.tsx             # Column definitions
│   │   │   └── index.ts
│   │   └── EmptyState.tsx              # No data component
│   └── leads/
│       ├── LeadCard.tsx                # Lead summary card
│       ├── LeadForm.tsx                # Edit/create form
│       └── LeadStatusBadge.tsx         # Status display
├── pages/
│   └── leads/
│       ├── index.tsx                   # List page
│       └── [id].tsx                    # Detail page
```

**Integration Points:**
- DataTable uses `filterStore` for state
- LeadTable uses `useLeads` hook from Phase 2
- Forms use React Hook Form + Zod
- Status updates use `useUpdateLead` mutation

**Key Features:**
- URL state synchronization
- Optimistic updates
- Loading skeletons
- Error boundaries
- Responsive design

### 4. Enhance Navigation with Role-Based Links (0.5-1 day)

- Update Header component with navigation menu
- Implement role/initiative-based link visibility:
  - "Results Dashboard" for ec-oregon initiative
  - "Foster Leads" for Foster Partner role (ec-kentucky)
  - "Volunteer Leads" for Volunteer Partner role (ec-kentucky)
- Create navigation configuration system
- Test with different user roles and initiatives

**📊 Implementation Progress:**
1. ✅ Backend Infrastructure: COMPLETE
   - D365 filter middleware ✓
   - Lead management API ✓
   - Authentication & security ✓

2. ✅ Phase 1 - State Management: COMPLETE
   - uiStore (loading, modals, toasts) ✓
   - filterStore (search, filters, pagination) ✓
   - Store utilities and types ✓

3. 🎯 Phase 2 - Data Fetching: READY TO START
   - TanStack Query hooks for leads
   - Error handling integration
   - Store synchronization

4. ⏳ Phase 3 - Lead Management UI: PENDING
   - Reusable table components
   - Lead pages (list/detail)
   - Form integration

5. ⏳ Phase 4 - Navigation Enhancement: PENDING
   - Role-based menu items
   - Initiative-specific routes

**🔧 Technical Debt & Considerations:**
- ESLint configuration needs fixing (known issue with @typescript-eslint)
- Consider implementing React Error Boundaries before Phase 3
- Plan for loading skeleton components
- Design empty states for better UX

**🔒 Security Reminders:**
- Never store sensitive data in Zustand stores
- Initiative filtering is enforced server-side
- 404 responses for unauthorized access (not 403)
- All API calls include JWT automatically

**💡 Tips for Next Session:**
1. Start with query keys factory pattern
2. Test error scenarios early
3. Use React Query DevTools for debugging
4. Keep loading states in TanStack Query, not Zustand
5. Remember pagination updates after successful queries
