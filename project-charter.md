# Partner Portal v2.0 (Vite + React + Express) - Project Charter

## Project Overview

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developing the Partner Portal v2.0. The project transitions from our current model of disparate, cloned Power Pages instances to a **single, centralized platform** built using a decoupled architecture with Vite + React (frontend) and Express.js (backend).

This strategic shift is driven by the critical need to overcome the scalability limitations, maintenance overhead, and branding inflexibility inherent in the previous multi-instance approach. Partner Portal v2.0 aims to deliver a unified, scalable, and maintainable solution that efficiently supports our expanding operations across multiple U.S. states, each represented as an "Initiative."

A core tenet of this project is to **preserve and potentially enhance the existing lead management capabilities** currently valued by our external partner organizations. This includes secure access to assigned leads, comprehensive dashboard views with filtering and search, detailed lead information management, and role-based access control tailored to their organizational context (e.g., differentiating access for Foster and Volunteer journeys, and scoping visibility to specific organizations or network-wide).

The new architecture, detailed herein, emphasizes clear separation of concerns, API-first design, robust security through initiative-based data segregation, and dynamic theming. This will provide a modern, reliable, and intuitive interface for our partners, significantly reducing operational burdens and accelerating the delivery of future improvements.

### Purpose

The Partner Portal v2.0 project implements a decoupled Single Page Application (SPA) + API architecture to serve as a Proof of Concept (POC) and foundational platform. This POC aims to:

* **Validate Architecture:** Demonstrate that a Vite + React frontend and an Express.js backend can effectively meet our organization's requirements for a centralized, scalable, and maintainable multi-state partner portal.
* **Deliver Core Functionality:** Build essential features focused on secure authentication, initiative-based data segregation, dynamic theming, and core lead management capabilities.
* **Establish Best Practices:** Implement and refine development patterns, security measures, and deployment strategies for this new architecture.
* **Mitigate Scalability Risks:** Directly address the limitations of the current "cloned instance" model by proving a single platform's ability to support multiple U.S. state "initiatives" with distinct branding and data boundaries.
* **Enhance Developer Experience:** Leverage modern tooling and a clear separation of concerns to improve development velocity and knowledge sharing.

This initiative will confirm the chosen technology stack's suitability to replace the existing Power Pages solution, providing a robust foundation for future enhancements and national rollout.

### Guiding Principles

- **Security**: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Stability**: Build reliable, predictable, and fault-tolerant systems
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and multi-state expansion
- **Maintainability**: Create clean, documented, and modular code
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Build code that's accessible across all experience levels
- **Clarity**: Develop intuitive interfaces and clear code patterns
- **Simplicity**: Favor straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Modern Best Practices**: Utilize current industry standards and patterns
- **Efficiency**: Eliminate redundant processes and optimize for both development velocity and system performance

## Architecture Overview

**Important Note for AI Agents:** This document contains references such as "(portable from Next.js)" or "(adapted from Next.js)". These allude to components and logic from a previous, internal Next.js prototype. You do not require any further context or code from this Next.js prototype to understand and assist with the goals of this current Vite + React + Express project. These notes primarily serve as reminders for the human developer leading this project.

### Frontend (Vite + React SPA)
- **Build Tool**: Vite (latest stable version - verify before install)
- **Framework**: React (latest stable version) with TypeScript (latest stable version)
- **Routing**: React Router (latest stable version - currently v7.x) for client-side navigation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (latest stable version) with shadcn/ui components (portable from Next.js)
- **State Management**:
  - Zustand for UI state with structured store architecture (portable from Next.js)
  - TanStack Query (latest stable version) for server state (portable from Next.js)
  - State persistence layer for user preferences and filters
  - Multi-tab synchronization for consistency
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod (portable from Next.js)
- **Tables**: TanStack Table (latest stable version) (portable from Next.js)
- **Development**: Vite dev server with proxy to Express API
- **Deployment**: Azure Static Web Apps

### Backend (Express API)
- **Runtime**: Node.js (latest LTS version - currently 22.x) with Express (latest stable version - currently 5.x) and TypeScript
- **Authentication**: MSAL Node (official Microsoft library)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with OpenAPI documentation
- **Validation**: Zod for request/response validation
- **D365 Integration**: Existing D365 service code (adapted from Next.js)
- **Initiative Security**: Mandatory initiative-based filtering on all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware
- **Security**: Helmet.js, CORS, rate limiting, initiative boundary enforcement
- **Deployment**: Azure App Service or Azure Functions

### Shared Infrastructure
- **TypeScript Types**: Shared types package for frontend/backend contracts
- **Initiative Configuration**: Centralized theme and branding definitions
- **State Patterns**: Documented state management conventions
- **Environment Config**: Separate .env files for frontend/backend
- **CI/CD**: Azure DevOps with parallel frontend/backend pipelines
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights for both layers with initiative tracking

## Multi-State Initiative Architecture

### Initiative Context
Each U.S. state expansion is managed through security groups in Microsoft Entra ID:
- Users are assigned to Entra ID security groups (e.g., "EC Arkansas", "EC Oregon")
- Portal users see initiative-specific theming based on their Entra ID group membership
- **Critical**: Users can ONLY access data tagged with their initiative

### Security Model
Microsoft Entra ID groups serve as the **hard security boundary**:
1. JWT tokens include initiative claims from Entra ID group membership
2. All API endpoints enforce initiative-based filtering using group claims
3. Frontend queries include initiative in all data requests
4. Cross-initiative access attempts trigger security alerts

### Role-Based Access Control
Microsoft Entra ID App Roles will define user permissions. The roles are designed to provide granular access based on user responsibilities and organizational structure:

-   **Admin**: Retains full access to all features and administrative functions within their assigned initiative.
-   **Foster Partner**: Granted access to all portal features specifically related to foster journeys, but this access is restricted to foster journeys associated with the user's own organization.
-   **Volunteer Partner**: Granted access to all portal features specifically related to volunteer journeys, with access limited to volunteer journeys associated with the user's own organization.
-   **Volunteer Network-Wide Partner**: Possesses comprehensive access to all portal features concerning volunteer journeys, with the ability to view and manage volunteer journeys across all participating organizations within the network.
-   **Foster Network-Wide Partner**: Possesses comprehensive access to all portal features concerning foster journeys, with the ability to view and manage foster journeys across all participating organizations within the network.

Roles will be assigned in Microsoft Entra ID and will be included as claims in the JWT, enabling the application to enforce permissions accordingly.

## Reusable Components from Next.js Implementation

## Development Approach

### Version Management Strategy

**Core Dependency Versions**: The major dependency versions specified in this charter have been verified as of the last charter update and are suitable for project initialization.

**Feature-Specific Dependencies**: When implementing features that require new dependencies, verify latest stable versions before installation:

1. **Web Search First**: Perform a web search to confirm the latest stable versions of new dependencies
2. **Official Sources**: Check npm registry, official GitHub releases, and documentation
3. **Avoid Assumptions**: Don't assume training data contains the latest versions
4. **Document Versions**: Record specific versions in `VERSIONS.md` when installed

Example verification process for new dependencies:
```bash
# Before adding new feature dependencies
npm view [new-package]@latest version
npm view [another-package]@latest version
```

### Parallel Development Strategy

Unlike the Next.js POC approach, the decoupled architecture allows for parallel frontend/backend development:

1. **API-First Design**: Define OpenAPI contracts with initiative requirements
2. **Mock Development**: Frontend can use mock APIs with test initiatives
3. **Independent Testing**: Each layer can be tested in isolation
4. **Progressive Integration**: Connect real APIs as they're ready

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Why MSAL Node over Auth.js?
- Official Microsoft library with guaranteed Azure AD compatibility
- Better suited for API-based authentication flows
- More control over token handling and validation
- Direct support for advanced Azure AD features including groups and app roles
- Native support for extracting Entra ID claims from tokens

#### API Design Principles
- RESTful design with consistent naming
- Versioned endpoints (/api/v1/...)
- Mandatory initiative filtering on all data endpoints
- Standardized error responses
- Comprehensive request/response validation
- HATEOAS where beneficial

#### Frontend State Strategy
- **Server State**: TanStack Query exclusively for API data
  - Query keys always include initiative
  - Automatic cache invalidation on initiative change
- **UI State**: Structured Zustand stores with clear separation:
  - `useAuthStore`: Authentication, user profile, initiative, theme
  - `useUIStore`: Loading states, modals, notifications
  - `useFilterStore`: Global filters, search parameters, table states
- **Form State**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **URL State**: React Router for navigation and deep linking
- **Persistence**: Selective state persistence with fallback strategies
- **Synchronization**: Multi-tab consistency via BroadcastChannel API

#### Initiative-Based Architecture
```typescript
// JWT Token Structure
interface JWTPayload {
  sub: string;
  email: string;
  groups: string[]; // Entra ID security groups (e.g., ["EC Arkansas", "EC Oregon"])
  roles: string[]; // Entra ID app roles (e.g., ["Admin", "Foster Partner", "Volunteer Network-Wide Partner"])
  initiative: string; // Primary initiative derived from groups
  exp: number;
}

// Query Key Factory with Initiative
const queryKeys = {
  leads: (initiative: string, filters?: LeadFilters) =>
    ['leads', initiative, filters] as const,

  lead: (initiative: string, id: string) =>
    ['leads', initiative, id] as const,
};

// Backend Middleware
const enforceInitiative = async (req, res, next) => {
  // Extract primary initiative from groups
  const userGroups = req.user.groups || [];
  const initiativeGroup = userGroups.find(g => g.startsWith('EC '));

  if (!initiativeGroup) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'No initiative access' });
  }

  const userInitiative = initiativeGroup;

  // Inject into all D365 queries
  req.d365Filter = {
    ...req.d365Filter,
    'initiative': userInitiative
  };

  // Log access for audit
  logger.info('Data access', {
    userId: req.user.sub,
    initiative: userInitiative,
    groups: userGroups,
    roles: req.user.roles,
    endpoint: req.path
  });

  next();
};

// Theme Configuration
const initiativeThemes: Record<string, ThemeConfig> = {
  'EC Arkansas': {
    primaryColor: '#00B274',
    secondaryColor: '#313E48',
    logo: '/logos/arkansas.svg',
    favicon: '/favicons/arkansas.ico',
    name: 'Arkansas Partner Portal',
  },
  'EC Tennessee': {
    primaryColor: '#F38359',
    secondaryColor: '#313E48',
    logo: '/logos/tennessee.svg',
    favicon: '/favicons/tennessee.ico',
    name: 'Tennessee Partner Portal',
  },
};
```

#### Security Considerations
- **Frontend**: CSP, secure token storage, input sanitization
- **Backend**: Rate limiting, CORS, helmet.js, input validation
- **Communication**: HTTPS only, JWT with short expiry
- **Data**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **State**: No sensitive data in persisted state
- **Initiative Boundary**: Enforced at API level, monitored continuously

### Migration Path from Next.js

1. **Phase 1**: Port UI components and establish design system
2. **Phase 2**: Implement authentication with MSAL and initiative support
3. **Phase 3**: Migrate business logic to Express API with initiative filtering
4. **Phase 4**: Connect frontend to real API with initiative-aware queries
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization and security hardening

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Frontend development
cd packages/frontend
npm run dev              # Starts Vite dev server on port 5173

# Backend development
cd packages/backend
npm run dev              # Starts Express with nodemon on port 3000

# Full stack development
docker-compose up        # Runs both with proper networking

# Testing with different initiatives
npm run dev:arkansas     # Test with Arkansas theme/data
npm run dev:kentucky     # Test with Kentucky theme/data
```

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) Summary

Beyond specific features, Partner Portal v2.0 must adhere to the following key non-functional requirements to ensure its success and long-term viability:

* **Scalability:**
    * Support a growing number of "Initiatives" (target: 50+ U.S. states) without degradation in performance or requiring separate deployments.
    * Handle a significant number of concurrent users (target: 1000+) efficiently.
    * Allow independent scaling of frontend and backend services.
* **Performance:**
    * Initial application load time: < 2 seconds.
